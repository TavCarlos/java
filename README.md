# My Java Repository: Learning Java

  Welcome to my java repositosy. Here you'll find a variety of projects and exercises that reflect my journey of learning and improving my Java programming skills. Over time, I have explored various aspects of the language and various related technologies, ranging from basic control structures to database connections using JDBC.

# Repository Structure

Calculator: In this project, I developed a calculator using the Swing library to create the graphical user interface. It serves as a great example of how to build Java desktop applications.

Campo Minado: This project showcases a simple and enjoyable implementation of the Minesweeper. Throught this project, I acquired fundamental concepts of logic, code structuring, swing library and Observer pattern in java.

Java Exercises: In this folder, you will find a collection of exercises that I completed during my Java learning journey. These exercises cover everything from basic concepts to more complex challenges, and they represent an essential part of my learning experience. Each exercise has numerous annotations explaining the reasoning behind the solutions and providing additional information for study.

JavaFX Exercises: I explored the JavaFX platform to create richer and more dynamic graphical user interfaces. Here, you will find projects that demonstrate the use of JavaFX for building more attractive desktop applications.

Java JPA: In this section, I focused on learning Java Persistence API (JPA), a specification that enables Java to integrate with relational databases. The projects here illustrate how to perform persistence operations using JPA.

SpringBoot: This section contains projects that explore the Spring Boot framework. Learning Spring Boot was a significant milestone in my Java development journey as it simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications.
